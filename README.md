# Manager Code

### Your team builds your product, you build your team.

If you are a technical EM you're *almost* the right person to contribute to your team's code but you're just not. You don't have the deep context necessary to make appropriate fixes in a timely manner. If you do have that context then you're probably a veteran at the company and managing a team that works on a code base you're familiar with is likely presenting a situation that tempts you to code and avoid doing the harder, less-immediately-satisfying the management work.
Solution: Put your coding interests into projects that analyze and give you visibility into your team – the domain you _do_ have deep context in.

This repo is a place for me to dump one specific project, git contributor cluster analysis that I wanted to play with in early 2018. Feel free to use this in any way you wish and please share your tips with me about tools you build to enhance your usefulness to the people you serve.
